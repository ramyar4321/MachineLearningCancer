    "\n",
    "Cancer is a devasting disease that has impacted the lives of many people. It is estimated that 50% of all Canadians will be diagnoised with Cancer in their lifetime, and 25% will die from the disease<sup>[[1]](#canada_cancer_statistics)</sup>. Research in the field is paramount in order to save lives. Interestingly, Machine Learning has become a key area in cancer research, specifically, in cancer susceptibility perdiction, recurrence prediction, and survival prediction<sup>[[2]](#machinelearning_cancer)</sup>. The goal of this project is to explore Machine Learning fundementals and it will be divided into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this project will involve applying several Machine Learning techniques to a Breast Cancer dataset. Machine lEanrign mdoels will be made that can perdict if the tumour cellular sample is benign or malignant. This is important since it can automate part of the diagnosis procedure, thus saving lives. \n",

    "Before we move on, it would be wise to attempt to describe the columns of the dataset. Initially, [Fine Needle Asipration](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/breast-biopsy/fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-of-the-breast.html) is used to collect small tissue/fluid samples from  suspected tumour areas of the breast. A small subsample of the aspiration is then digitized for image analysis. 596 images were perpared and used for anlysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most cells nucleus in the human body are usually uniform spheroid, whereas tumour cell nucleus tend to have abnormal geometries, as shown in Figure 1<sup>[[3]](#cancercellimage)</sup>. \n",

    "<center>Figure 1: Breast tumour cells have irregularities in their shape due to having mulitple nucleus and nucleoulus, in comparison to healthy breast cells. </center>\n",
    "Certain features of these shape irregularitites may help in differentiating between begnin and maligmant tumour cells, thus cell nucleus feature extraction becomes important.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of nuclear feature extraction is to identify cell nuclei boundraries in each sample image. The researchers used a computer vision framework known as [Active contour model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_contour_model) in order to find th boundaraies of identifable cell nuclie in each sample image. Dotted lines, refered to as \"snakes\", are used to determine the boundaries of the cell nuclei, as shown in figure 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that snakes have been created for cell nuclei for the 596 sample images, cell nucleus shape feautes can be determined using those snakes. \n"
