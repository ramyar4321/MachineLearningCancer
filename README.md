# Machine Learning Applications in Breast Cancer Research

The purpose of this project was to explore machine learning applications in breast cancer research. 

## Prerequisites

The project is fully viewable using GitHub. However, if you want to download and run the codes yourself, you would need the following installed on your system. 

* You will need [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed. 
* You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. My machine used python version 3.9.12.
* You will need the following packages installed: [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

## Issues

The equations and figures are not centered when using GitHub to view the Jupyter notebook. Using Jupyterlab, presents no issue of rendering the equations and tables.
